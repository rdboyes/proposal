  abstract = "A large body of research has identified correlates of risky
              sexual behavior, with depressive symptoms and marijuana use among
              the most consistent psychosocial predictors of sexual risk.
              However, substantially less research has examined the
              relationship between these risk variables and adolescent risky
              sexual behavior over time as well as the interaction of these
              individual-level predictors with family-level variables such as
              parenting factors. Additionally, most studies have been
              restricted to one index of risky sexual behavior, have not taken
              into account the complex role of gender, and have not controlled
              for several of the factors that independently confer risk for
              risky sexual behavior. Therefore, the current study investigated
              the association between depressive symptoms and parameters of
              parenting on marijuana use, number of sexual partners and condom
              usage measured 9 months later for both boys and girls.
              Participants were 9th and 10th grade adolescents (N = 1,145;
              57.7\% female). We found that depressive symptoms may be a
              gender-specific risk factor for certain indices of risky sexual
              behavior. For boys only, marijuana use at Time 2 accounted for
              the variance in the relationship between depressive symptoms at
              Time 1 and number of partners at Time 2. Additionally, strictness
              of family rules at Time 1 was associated with the number of
              partners with whom girls engaged in sex at Time 2, but only among
              those with lower levels of depressive symptoms at Time 1. Results
              from the current investigation speak to the utility of examining
              the complex, gender-specific pathways to sexual risk in
              adolescents. Findings suggest that treatment of mental health and
              substance use problems may have important implications in rates
              of risky sexual behavior and, conceivably, controlling the high
              rates of serious individual and public health repercussions.",

              this study was to examine perceptions of intergenerational
              changes in active free play among families from rural areas. We
              addressed two research questions: (1) How has active free play
              changed across three generations? (2) What suggestions do
              participants have for reviving active free play? METHODS: Data
              were collected via 49 individual interviews with members of 16
              families (15 grandparents, 16 parents, and 18 children) residing
              in rural areas/small towns in the Province of Alberta (Canada).
              Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and subjected to
              thematic analysis guided by an ecological framework of active
              free play. RESULTS: Factors that depicted the changing nature of
              active free play were coded in the themes of less
              imagination/more technology, safety concerns, surveillance, other
              children to play with, purposeful physical activity, play
              spaces/organized activities, and the good parenting ideal.
              Suggestions for reviving active free play were coded in the
              themes of enhance facilities to keep kids entertained, provide
              more opportunities for supervised play, create more community
              events, and decrease use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: These
              results reinforce the need to consider multiple levels of social
              ecology in the study of active free play, and highlight the
              importance of community-based initiatives to revive active free
              play in ways that are consistent with contemporary notions of
              good parenting.",

              analyses were conducted using data from the Healthy Beginnings
              Trial (HBT). Data on children's outdoor playtime and mothers'
              perceived neighbourhood environment were collected through
              face-to-face interviews with mothers when their children were 2
              and 3.5 years old. Walk score was obtained from a publicly
              available website and population density data were obtained from

              parents' and children's questionnaires regarding to socioeconomic
              deprivation were 830 (88.1\%) from 942 and 932 (97.9\%) from 952
              respectively. Overall, 224 (27.0\%) parents believed that the

              is a more hazardous place than the less deprived areas, it
              suggests that the risk perception among the more deprived parents

              included multivariable analysis of childhood maltreatment
              exposure and problem gambling were identified. Six of seven
              studies examining childhood sexual abuse and four of five
              examining physical abuse showed a significant positive
              association between abuse and later gambling problems (odds
              ratios for sexual abuse 2.01-3.65; physical abuse 2.3-2.8). Both
              studies examining psychological maltreatment and two of three
              examining neglect identified positive associations with problem
              gambling. In most studies, risks were reduced or eliminated when
              controlling for other mental health disorders. The three studies
              measuring risk of child abuse and neglect among current problem
              gamblers suggest an increased risk for child physical abuse and
              medical conditions indicative of neglect although there is a
              considerable amount of variation among studies. Child abuse is
              associated with increased risk of gambling problems - gambling
              treatment providers should ask about maltreatment history as part
              of their clinical assessment. Problem gamblers may be more likely
              to physically abuse or neglect their children, but data here are
              more limited. Child welfare professionals should consider asking
              questions about parental gambling when assessing family
              risk.Copyright \copyright{} 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Research has shown that childhood maltreatment is
              associated with sexual risk taking among female juvenile
              offenders; however, the mechanisms by which maltreatment
              influences sexual risk remain poorly understood. We assessed
              whether substance abuse, psychological distress, and dating
              violence mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment
              and unprotected sex. METHODS: Sexually active female juvenile
              offenders (13-17 years of age) completed audio computer-assisted
              self-interviews (n = 232). Logistic regression with a risk
              decrement approach, the Sobel test, and the Goodman I test were
              used to evaluate mediation. RESULTS: Maltreatment before sixth
              grade was common in our sample, including physical abuse
              (48.7\%), sexual abuse (14.7\%), supervision neglect (57.3\%),
              and physical neglect (18.5\%). Cumulative childhood maltreatment
              was also high with 42.2\% reporting two or more types. In the
              fully adjusted model, cumulative childhood maltreatment remained
              associated with unprotected sex (odds ratio, 2.43; 95\%
              confidence interval, 1.27, 4.65). The percent of the total effect
              in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and
              unprotected sex that was mediated by substance abuse was 16.4\%
              (Sobel = 2.54 [p = .01]; Goodman I = 2.49 [p = .01]) and
              psychological distress accounted for 23.7\% (Sobel = 2.55 [p =
              .01]; Goodman I = 2.51 [p = .01]). Dating violence was not a
              significant mediator in our analyses. CONCLUSION: We found a
              strong relationship between childhood maltreatment and
              unprotected sex among female juvenile offenders that was
              partially mediated through substance abuse and psychological
              distress. These findings can be used to develop public health
              strategies to increase condom use among female juvenile

              children, but are associated with an increase of
              trampoline-related injuries. The aim of this study was to
              evaluate radiographs of children with trampoline related injuries
              and to determine the risk factors. METHODS: Between 2003 and
              2009, 286 children under the age of 16 with backyard trampoline
              injuries were included in the study. The number of injuries
              increased from 13 patients in 2003 to 86 in 2009. The median age
              of the 286 patients was 7 years (range: 1-15 years). Totally 140
              (49\%) patients were males, and 146 (51\%) females. Medical
              records and all available diagnostic imaging were reviewed. A
              questionnaire was sent to the parents to evaluate the
              circumstances of each injury, the type of trampoline, the
              protection equipment and the experience of the children using the
              trampoline. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics
              Committee of the University Hospital of Bern. RESULTS: The
              questionnaires and radiographs of the 104 patients were available
              for evaluation. A fracture was sustained in 51 of the 104
              patients. More than 75\% of all patients sustaining injuries and
              in 90\% of patients with fractures were jumping on the trampoline
              with other children at the time of the accident. The most common
              fractures were supracondylar humeral fractures (29\%) and forearm
              fractures (25\%). Fractures of the proximal tibia occurred
              especially in younger children between 2-5 years of age.
              CONCLUSIONS: Children younger than 5 years old are at risk for
              specific proximal tibia fractures (``Trampoline Fracture''). A
              child jumping simultaneously with other children has a higher

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The relationship between childhood residential
              mobility and health in the UK is not well established; however,
              research elsewhere suggests that frequent childhood moves may be
              associated with poorer health outcomes and behaviours. The aim of
              this paper was to compare people in the West of Scotland who were
              residentially stable in childhood with those who had moved in
              terms of a range of health measures. METHODS: A total of 850
              respondents, followed-up for a period of 20 years, were included
              in this analysis. Childhood residential mobility was derived from
              the number of addresses lived at between birth and age 18.
              Multilevel regression was used to investigate the relationship
              between childhood residential mobility and health in late
              adolescence (age 18) and adulthood (age 36), accounting for
              socio-demographic characteristics and frequency of school moves.
              The authors examined physical health measures, overall health,
              psychological distress and health behaviours. RESULTS: Twenty per
              cent of respondents remained stable during childhood, 59\% moved
              one to two times and 21\% moved at least three times. For most
              health measures (except physical health), there was an increased
              risk of poor health that remained elevated for frequent movers
              after adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics and school
              moves (but was only significant for illegal drug use).
              CONCLUSIONS: Risk of poor health was elevated in adolescence and
              adulthood with increased residential mobility in childhood, after
              adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and school moves.
              This was true for overall health, psychological distress and

              Additionally, we examined whether and to what extent trajectories
              of parent-adolescent family functioning discrepancies vary as a
              function of gender. We assessed family functioning of 302
              Hispanic adolescents (47 \% female) and their parent (70 \%
              female) at six time points over a three-year period and computed
              latent discrepancy scores between parent and adolescent reports

              of sexual risk behaviors and alcohol use. We conducted a

              collapsing parent and adolescent reported family functioning
              indicators onto a single latent discrepancy variable, tested
              model invariance over time, and conducted growth mixture modeling

              High-Increasing, High-Stable, and Low-Stable. Relative to the
              Low-Stable class, parent-adolescent dyads in the High-Increasing

              reporting sexual debut at time 6. Additionally, the High-Stable

              Academic. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Young people spend 2-4 hours per
              day in screen-based behaviors and 5-10 hours per day sedentary.
              Ethnicity, sociodemographic status, having a TV set in the

              to reduce TV viewing or sedentary time among young people have
              been successful. CONCLUSIONS: A growing body of evidence supports
              the development of public health recommendations to limit the
              time spent in screen-based behaviors. More research is needed to
              examine the prospective and experimental evidence of associations

              normative symptoms (low), severe-decreasing symptoms (initially

              trajectories. Next, joint models examined how parenting
              trajectories overlapped with internalizing and externalizing
              symptom trajectories. These trajectory classes demonstrated that,
              normatively, harsh parenting increased after toddlerhood, but the
              severe symptoms class was characterized by a higher level and a
              steeper increase in harsh parenting and the severe-decreasing

              development study. The World Health Organization framework
              International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
              Health was used. METHODS: Participants were children (6-8 years
              old) with motor impairments, mobilizing independently with or
              without equipment and seen by physical therapists or occupational
              therapists in 6 regions in the United Kingdom, and their parents.
              Self-reported PPP was assessed with the Children's Assessment of
              Participation and Enjoyment. Modifiable-factor data were
              collected with therapists' observations, parent questionnaires,
              and child-friendly interviews. The Children's Assessment of
              Participation and Enjoyment, therapist, and parent data were
              analyzed using descriptive statistics and linear regression.
              Interview data were analyzed for emerging themes. RESULTS:
              Children's (n=195) PPP (X=18 times per week, interquartile
              range=11-25) was mainly 'recreational' (eg, pretend play, playing
              with pets) rather than 'active physical' (eg, riding a
              bike/scooter). Parents (n=152) reported positive beliefs about
              children's PPP but various levels of family PPP. Therapists
              reported 23 unique impairments (eg, muscle tone), 16 activity
              limitations (eg, walking), and 3 personal factors (eg, child's
              PPP confidence). Children interviewed (n=17) reported a strong
              preference for active play but indicated that adults regulated
              their PPP. Family PPP and impairment in the child's
              movement-related body structures explained 18\% of the variation
              in PPP. Family PPP explained most of the variation. LIMITATIONS:
              It is likely that the study had a degree of self-selection bias,
              and caution must be taken in generalizing the results to children
              whose parents have less positive views about PPP. CONCLUSIONS:
              The results converge with wider literature about the child's
              social context as a PPP intervention target. In addition, the
              results question therapists' observations in explaining PPP.",

              standardized grading framework (from A = excellent, to F =
              failing). The 38 Report Cards were presented at the International
              Congress on Physical Activity and Public Health in Bangkok,
              Thailand on November 16, 2016. The consolidated findings are
              summarized in the form of a Global Matrix demonstrating
              substantial variation in grades both within and across countries.
              Countries that lead in certain indicators often lag in others.
              Average grades for both Overall Physical Activity and Sedentary
              Behavior around the world are D (low/poor). In contrast, the
              average grade for indicators related to supports for physical
              activity was C. Lower-income countries generally had better
              grades on Overall Physical Activity, Active Transportation, and
              Sedentary Behaviors compared with higher-income countries, yet
              worse grades for supports from Family and Peers, Community and
              the Built Environment, and Government Strategies and Investments.
              Average grades for all indicators combined were highest (best) in
              Denmark, Slovenia, and the Netherlands. Many surveillance and
              research gaps were apparent, especially for the Active Play and
              Family and Peers indicators. International cooperation and
              cross-fertilization is encouraged to address existing challenges,
              understand underlying determinants, conceive innovative
              solutions, and mitigate the global childhood inactivity crisis.
              The paradox of higher physical activity and lower sedentary
              behavior in countries reporting poorer infrastructure, and lower
              physical activity and higher sedentary behavior in countries

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: A substantial increase in the number of nonpowered and
              powered scooter injuries since 2000 has occurred in the United
              States. Because of differences in weight and operational speed
              between scooter types, it is possible that the type and severity
              of injuries may differ. The purpose of the current study is to
              compare demographics and injury characteristics between scooter
              types, focusing on differences in injury severity. METHODS: The
              2002-2006 National Electronic Injury Surveillance System provided
              information about individuals aged 2 to 12 years who sought
              treatment at an emergency department due to powered or nonpowered
              scooter-related injury in the United States. We defined severe
              injury as an injury resulting in the hospitalization, staying in
              the hospital for observation, or transfer of the injured patient.
              Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for sex, age, and
              geographic location in which the injury occurred, estimated odds
              ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the
              association between scooter type and severe injury. RESULTS:
              There were an estimated 15 752 and 185 007 injuries related to
              powered and nonpowered scooters, respectively. Powered
              scooter-related injuries were over 3 times as likely to be severe
              (OR 3.57, 95\% CI, 1.91-6.65). This association was more
              prominent among females (OR 5.80, 95\% CI, 2.02-16.63) than males
              (OR 2.90, 95\% CI, 1.44-5.82). CONCLUSION: Data suggest that,
              compared with nonpowered scooter-related injuries, powered
              scooter-related injuries are more often severe. This association
              is stronger among females than males. The higher risk of severe
              injury due to powered scooter use could result from increases in
              concussions and hip and lower extremity injuries.",

              play for children of varying ages and competencies. This is
              crucial because play spaces designed expressly for physical

              self-reports of each type of behavior equally. The importance of
              assessing health-risk behaviors as part of research activities
              involving adolescents necessitates the use of self-report
              measures. Researchers should familiarize themselves with the
              threats to validity inherent in this type of assessment and
              design research that minimizes these threats as much as possible.",

              summer camp taking place in the Vologda Region of Russia were
              exposed to 1 session context/day (i.e., free play, organized with
              no choice, organized with choice) on Wednesday, Thursday, and
              Friday for 3 weeks, with the context order counterbalanced across
              the 3 weeks. The organized session sport/game changed weekly. The
              primary outcome was accelerometer-assessed PA. Repeated-measures

              Findings showed that girls spent a greater percentage of session

              poorly understood. The Population Health Framework suggests that
              the etiology of adolescent injury involves interactions between
              individual risk factors and the natures of adolescent
              environments. The purpose of this study was to apply this
              framework to examination of relationships between adolescent risk
              taking and injury, and the potential modifying effects of
              supportive home and school environments. METHODS: The analysis
              was conducted in a representative sample of 7235 males and
              females (10-16 years old) from Canada. Results were based on
              records from the 2001/02 World Health Organization Health
              Behaviour in School-Aged Children Survey. Individual items and
              factor analytically derived scales were used to describe and then
              model injury outcomes, risk behaviors, perceived home, and school
              climates, and the relationships between these variables in a
              theory driven etiological analysis. RESULTS: Adolescents with
              supportive home and school environments experienced lower
              relative odds of engagement in risk taking behavior and lower
              relative odds of injury. Gradients were observed between the
              extent of adolescent risk taking and the occurrence of injury.
              Interactions were not observed between risk taking behavior,
              perceived support in home and school climates, and injury.
              CONCLUSIONS: Risk taking is common among adolescents and plays a
              role in the etiology of injury. Supportive social climates
              clearly protect adolescents from engaging in these behaviors, and
              also the occurrence of some forms of injury. However, once an
              adolescent chooses to engage in risk taking behaviour, a
              supportive environment may not protect them from injury.",

              adolescents with problematic musculoskeletal pain, compared to

              substance use, and poor mental health were collected from 1831
              year 9 students (age range, 14-16 years). Participants were
              considered to have problematic pain if they reported experiencing
              pain at least monthly over a 6-month period that also required
              medication or impacted 1 or more of the following: school or
              work, daily activities, and leisure or sporting activities.
              Results Almost half (46\%) of the participants experienced
              problematic pain. Adolescents with problematic pain, compared to
              those without pain, reported higher substance use and poorer
              mental health: tobacco smoking in the last 4 weeks, 12\% versus

              Inventory scores ($\beta$ = -11.43; standard error [SE], 0.96;

              Adolescents with problematic pain report higher smoking, alcohol

              been suggested as factors contributing to the increased
              prevalence of overweight and obesity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate
              whether objectively measured sleep duration (average and
              day-to-day variability) as well as parent-reported sleep problems
              are independently associated with proposed dietary risk factors

              this cross-sectional study, data on sleep duration and day-to-day
              variability in sleep duration were measured in 676 Danish,
              apparently healthy children by an objective measure (actigraphy)
              for 8 nights, and the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire
              (CSHQ) was filled out by the parents. Diet was recorded using a
              web-based food record for 7 consecutive days. Fasting blood
              samples were obtained for measurements of plasma leptin and
              ghrelin levels. RESULTS: Sleep duration (h per night) was
              negatively associated with energy density (ED) of the diet
              ($\beta$ = -0.32 kJ g(-1)), added sugar ($\beta$ = -1.50 E\%) and
              SSBs ($\beta$ = -1.07 E\%) (all P $\leq$ 0.003). Furthermore,
              variability in sleep duration (10-min per night) was positively
              associated with SSBs ($\beta$ = 0.20 E\%, P = 0.03), independent
              of sleep duration, and CSHQ score was positively associated with

              demographically similar children drawn from a home-based Head
              Start program participated in the study. All children were of low
              socioeconomic status. Children's free-play peer interactions were
              videotaped during the first 3 months of attendance in either
              program and analyzed along social and cognitive dimensions.
              Teachers and therapists rated children's social skills in peer
              interactions. RESULTS: Maltreated children were found to have
              significantly poorer skill in initiating interactions with peers
              and maintaining self-control, as well as a greater number of
              problem behaviors. Significant differences were not found between
              groups with regard to social participation or cognitive level of
              play. Significant correlations of moderate strength were found
              between social participation in play and social skills for the
              sample as a whole: total social skills score was positively
              related to interactive play, and negatively related to solitary
              play. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the experience of
              maltreatment has a negative impact on children's developing
              interpersonal skills above and beyond the influence of factors
              associated with low socioeconomic status and other environmental

              has been observed and it is well documented that low levels of
              activity are associated with poor health. In an attempt to
              understand factors that influence physical activity (PA) in young
              people research was undertaken with high school students in New
              Zealand to identify preferred places for PA and establish factors
              that they felt influenced levels of PA. METHODS: One hundred
              males and 73 females in year nine (aged 12-13) in health and
              physical education classes completed mapping exercises in which
              they delineated favourite and least favourite places for PA,
              where they went on a particular Sunday, how they got there and
              what they did, and chosen after-school activities and how they
              got there. RESULTS: Open public spaces were the most favoured
              places for PA with a nearby beach and park most frequently cited.
              Specific physical activities, having fun, and having friends to
              do an activity with were the most frequently cited reasons for
              liking these places. An industrial harbour area, other schools,
              and cemeteries were the least favoured places. Less than 2\%
              biked somewhere on the Sunday surveyed and only 23\% walked
              somewhere. The majority were driven to activities by car and a
              similar reliance on cars was observed for after-school
              activities. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of environmental and
              social factors is important in both encouraging and discouraging
              PA and should be taken into account when seeking to enhance PA of
              young people.",

              restricting outdoor play in response to a perceived lack of
              safety and fear of violence and crime in urban environments. The
              study objective was to determine whether parents who perceived
              their neighborhood as unsafe would be most likely to restrict
              their child's outdoor play and report the greatest worries
              related to neighborhood characteristics. METHODS: A convenience
              sample of primary caregivers of children aged 5 years to 7 years
              were recruited from a pediatric primary care center based at an
              urban academic children's hospital. Study participants completed
              a 23-question survey available in English and Spanish. RESULTS:
              Two hundred fifty-four parents completed the survey. Most were
              English speakers (69\%), female (89\%), and aged between 21 years
              and 35 years (76\%). Sixty-two percent let their child play
              outside often or sometimes; whereas 19\% reported never allowing
              their child to play outside. Parents were less likely to allow
              outside play as their degree of worry increased about traffic (p
              < 0.0001), rundown parks (p < 0.003), crime (p < 0.0001),
              witnessing violence (p < 0.0001), being a victim of violence (p <
              0.0009), drugs (p < 0.0001), gangs (p < 0.004), and weapons (p <
              0.003). Frequency of outdoor play was not correlated with the sex
              or age of the child or number of children in the family. Spanish
              speakers were less likely to allow outside play (p < 0.008) but
              more likely to allow unsupervised play (p < 0.03). CONCLUSIONS:
              Decreased frequency of outdoor play correlated with increased
              parental concerns about safety, however, many parents still
              report allowing outdoor play at least sometimes.",

              relationship between residential neighborhood amenities and
              physical activity among U.S. children with SHCN. Methods A
              nationally representative sample of 113,767 children aged 6-17
              years was taken from National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH)
              2007-2008 and 2011-2012. Residential neighborhood amenities were
              defined by parent-reported presence or absence of sidewalks,
              parks/playgrounds, and recreation center. Physical activity was
              measured by parent-reported number of physically active days
              (0-7), defined as 20 min or longer during the past week. Negative
              binomial regressions were performed to estimate the associations
              between residential neighborhood amenities and physical activity
              among U.S. children with and without SHCN, adjusting for various
              neighborhood (detracting condition and safety) and individual
              characteristics and NSCH sampling design. Results Approximately
              23\% of young children aged 6-11 years and adolescents aged 12-17
              years had SHCN. Number of weekly physically active days was both
              4.8 among young children with and without SHCN, and 3.7 and 4.1
              among adolescents with and without SHCN, respectively. Among
              young children with SHCN, neighborhood availability of a
              recreation center was associated with increased weekly physically
              active days by 0.23; whereas among young children without SHCN,
              number of weekly physically active days was not associated with
              the availability of any amenity. Among adolescents with SHCN,
              neighborhood availability of parks/playgrounds was associated
              with increased weekly physically active days by 0.33, whereas
              neighborhood availability of sidewalks was associated with

              used data from 2810 children from the Family and Child
              Experiences Survey 2006 cohort. With children's spring BMI as the
              outcome (both continuously measured and dichotomized to measure
              the risk of obesity), the authors conducted weighted regression
              analyses, controlling for child-level, family-level, and
              school-level covariates, including preschool entry BMI. RESULTS:
              Children played outdoors at school for roughly 37 minutes per
              day, with little variation across half-day and full-day programs.
              The more children played outdoors, the more their BMI decreased
              over the preschool year ($\beta$ = -.05, 95\% confidence interval
              (CI) [-0.08 to -0.01]) and the less likely they were to be obese
              (odds ratio = 0.99, 95\% CI [0.98-0.99]). The difference between
              high levels and low levels of outdoor play corresponded to 0.18
              BMI points and a 42\% reduction in children's risk of obesity.
              Sixty minutes was the ``tipping point'' for the association
              between outdoor play time and improvements in children's BMI.
              These associations were also stronger among children who were
              obese at the start of the year, less active at home, and living
              in unsafe neighborhoods. CONCLUSION: Outdoor play time at Head
              Start is associated with decreases in children's BMI scores and,
              thus, may serve as an important means of preventing obesity. Head

              the duration of children's outside play. METHODS: Parents
              participating in the ``Be Active, Eat Right'' cluster RCT control
              group (N = 2007) provided information on potential predictors of
              outside play (i.e. family and perceived physical environment) of
              their 5-year-old child by questionnaire. Child outside play was
              assessed by parental reports both at five and seven years. Linear
              regression analyses, adjusted for seasonality, were performed to
              evaluate associations between potential predictors and child
              outside play. Linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate the

              outside play over two years, with season entered as a random
              factor. RESULTS: Family environment was the strongest construct
              predicting child outside play, while parent perceived physical
              environment had no significant association with child outside
              play. Parental habit strength and the presence of rules were the

              predictor of decreased outside play. CONCLUSION: Family
              environment predicted child outside play and not perceived

              improving outside play were associated with an improvement of

               sources of health-related change. Age (or, life course) effects
               are individual, often biological, sources of change, whilst
               periods and cohorts can be thought of as social contexts
               affecting individuals that reside within them. Due to the
               mathematical confounding of age, period and cohort, careful
               consideration of each is important -- otherwise what appears to
               be, for example, a period (year) effect could in fact be a
               mixture of age and cohort processes. Naive life course
               approaches could thus produce misleading results when APC
               effects are not all considered. However, the mathematical
               confounding also often makes modelling all three effects
               together impossible, and the dangers of attempting to do so, or
               of ignoring one effect without critical forethought, is
               illustrated through the example of the obesity epidemic. This

               claimed (incorrectly) solves the identification problem.
               Finally, we suggest a flexible multilevel framework that extends
               Yang and Land's model, and by making relatively strong
               assumptions (in this case that there are no long-run period
               trends) can model age, period and cohort effects robustly and
               explicitly, so long as those assumptions are correct. This is
               illustrated using health data from the British Household Panel
               Survey. We argue that this theory driven approach is often the
               most appropriate for conceptualising APC effects, and producing
               valid empirical inference about both individual life courses and
               the spatial and temporal contexts in which they exist.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: To explore children's accounts of their experiences
              of the UK's largest childhood obesity programme, MEND (Mind,
              Exercise, Nutrition...Do it!) (See www.mendprogramme.org).
              DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with children
              who had completed the MEND obesity programme. Interviews were
              transcribed verbatim and analysed using Interpretative
              Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). METHOD: Fourteen children
              spanning diverse areas of London comprised this study (eight
              male, six female), aged between 11 and 14 years and in secondary
              school. Participants were interviewed a year after completing one
              of the London-based MEND obesity programmes. RESULTS: This
              article focuses on the most common and striking theme to emerge
              from the original dataset (The complete analysis may be found in
              L. Watson, Unpublished doctoral thesis): Fun. Subthemes were:
              'going with the flow'; active participation in activities that
              led to new experiences ('actually doing it' - seeing the fun
              side); the importance of others in the experience of fun ('you do
              games in unity' - 'it's not as fun on your own'). CONCLUSION:
              Children have fun when engaged in interactive and varied
              activities with opportunity for individual feedback and
              improvement. When designing childhood obesity programmes,
              conditions that optimise children's experience of fun should be
              emphasised over didactic and risk-heavy information pertaining to
              childhood obesity. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already
              known on this subject? Continued growth in childhood obesity and
              its associated health problems, psychological effects, and
              economic burden make tackling childhood obesity a public health
              priority. Multicomponent lifestyle interventions to treat
              childhood obesity within the community have been shown to reduce
              overweight and obesity from pre- to post-treatment, increase
              self-esteem, and are found to be acceptable by parents. MEND is
              the most widely disseminated evidence-based programme of this
              kind in the United Kingdom. What does this study add? This study
              is the first qualitative study to explore the child's experience
              of attending MEND. The post-treatment maintenance period, where
              most behaviour change is consolidated (or not), is also captured
              in this study, with children interviewed at least 1 year
              post-treatment. Findings unearthed an unexpected and strong theme
              - that of 'fun' - integral to their experience during their time
              at MEND. Optimizing conditions for fun is imperative to
              children's (and adults'?) engagement with, and maintenance of,
              healthy lifestyle activities.",

              department of infants with injuries for a geographically distinct
              population in Eastern Ontario. METHODS: Epidemiologic analysis of
              emergency-based surveillance data (1994-2000) for infants (<12
              months old) from the Kingston sites of the Canadian Hospitals
              Injury Reporting and Prevention Program. RESULTS: A total of 990
              cases of injury to infants were identified, of which 217 (21.9\%)
              required significant medical intervention. Leading causes of
              injury were falls (605/990; 61.1\%), ingestion injuries (65/990;
              6.6\%), and burns (56/990; 5.7\%). Common types of falls
              experienced were: from furniture (229/605; 37.9\%), being dropped
              (92/605; 15.2\%), in car seats (73/605; 12.1\%), down stairs
              (63/605; 10.4\%), or in a child walker (42/605; 6.9\%). The
              observed patterns of injury changed according to the ages of the
              children. Vignettes are used to illustrate recurrent injury
              patterns (falls, physical vulnerability, burns and ingestions,
              equipment injuries). CONCLUSION: The results indicate the
              relative importance of several external causes of injury and how
              these vary by age group. This population-based information is
              also useful in establishing rational priorities for prevention,

              to account for the impact that underlying differences between
              mobile and non-mobile youth have on this relationship. In this
              study we utilise multilevel models with longitudinal data to
              simultaneously estimate between-child and within-child effects in
              the relationship between residential mobility and cannabis use,
              allowing us to determine the extent to which cannabis use in
              adolescence is driven by residential mobility and unobserved
              confounding. Data come from a UK cohort, The Avon Longitudinal
              Study of Parents and Children. Consistent with previous research
              we find a positive association between cumulative residential
              mobility and cannabis use when using multilevel extensions of
              conventional logistic regression models (log odds: 0.94, standard
              error: 0.42), indicating that children who move houses are more
              likely to use cannabis than those who remain residentially
              stable. However, decomposing this relationship into within- and
              between-child components reveals that the conventional model is
              underspecified and misleading; we find that differences in
              cannabis use between mobile and non-mobile children are due to
              underlying differences between these groups (between-child log
              odds: 3.56, standard error: 1.22), not by a change in status of
              residential mobility (within-child log odds: 1.33, standard
              error: 1.02). Our findings suggest that residential mobility in

              worldwide. Determining risk factors for obesity may facilitate
              effective preventive programs. The present review focuses on
              sleep duration as a potential risk factor for childhood obesity.
              The aim is to summarize the evidence on the association of sleep
              duration and obesity and to discuss the underlying potential
              physiological and/or pathophysiological mechanisms. DATA
              SYNTHESIS: The Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus and Cochrane Central Register
              of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases were searched for papers
              using text words with appropriate truncation and relevant
              indexing terms. All studies objectively measuring sleep duration
              and investigating the association between sleep duration and
              obesity or factors (lifestyle and hormonal) possibly associated
              with obesity were included, without making restrictions based on
              study design or language. Data from eligible studies were
              extracted in tabular form and summarized narratively. After
              removing duplicates, 3540 articles were obtained. Finally, 33
              studies (including 3 randomized controlled trials and 30
              observational studies) were included in the review. CONCLUSION:
              Sleep duration seems to influence weight gain in children,
              however, the underlying explanatory mechanisms are still
              uncertain. In our review only the link between short sleep
              duration and the development of insulin resistance, sedentarism
              and unhealthy dietary patterns could be verified, while the role
              of other mediators, such as physical activity, screen time,
              change in ghrelin and leptin levels, remained uncertain. There
              are numerous evidence gaps. To answer the remaining questions,
              there is a need for studies meeting high methodological standards
              and including a large number of children.Copyright \copyright{}

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Among adolescents, risk behaviors often cluster
              together and lead to risk behaviour syndromes. Multiple risk
              behaviors in turn become important determinants of health
              outcomes, including injuries. METHODS: A national sample (n =
              11,415) of Canadian youth aged 11-15 years was examined from the
              1997-1998 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children Survey.
              Principal components analyses were used to characterize how
              adolescent risk behaviors cluster together into factors.
              Associations between these behavioral factors and injury outcomes
              were explored via multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS:
              Two factors of risk behaviors emerged: lifestyle risks and
              psychological risks. Strong associations between the lifestyle
              risk scale and the occurrence of head and neck injuries were
              identified (P < 0.001 for trend). The relative odds for the
              highest quintile versus the lowest quintile were 6.96 (95\% CI:
              3.95-12.26). Similar injury risks were not identified in

              findings provide novel information about potential causes of
              injury to young people and provide a reliable method by which
              researchers can quantify two determinants of health. These are

              review of qualitative research examining determinants of
              independent active free play in children. METHOD: Following
              systematic electronic and manual searches and application of

              subjected to meta-method, meta-theory, and meta-data analyses,
              followed by a final meta-synthesis. RESULTS: Identified
              determinants of independent active free play were child
              characteristics (age, competence, and gender), parental
              restrictions (safety concerns and surveillance), neighborhood and
              physical environment (fewer children to play with, differences in
              preferences for play spaces between parents and children,
              accessibility and proximity, and maintenance), societal changes
              (reduced sense of community, good parenting ideal, changing roles
              of parents, privatization of playtime and play spaces), and
              policy issues (need to give children voice). An ecological model
              depicting these factors, and the relationships therein, was
              created. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive meta-study helps
              establish a knowledge base for children's independent active free
              play research by synthesizing a previously fragmented set of
              studies. Parents' perceived safety concerns are the primary
              barrier to children's active free play. These safety concerns are
              moderated by child-level factors (age, competence, gender) and
              broader social issues. Interventions should focus on
              community-level solutions that include children's perspectives.
              From a methods perspective, the reviewed studies used a range of
              data collection techniques, but methodological details were often
              inadequately reported. The theoretical sophistication of research
              in this area could be improved. To this end, the synthesis

              three or more lifestyle risk factors. Males [adjusted odds ratio
              (aOR) = 2.50; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 2.17-2.88] and
              respondents of middle (aOR = 1.60; 95\% CI: 1.36-1.89) or lower
              income (aOR = 2.63; 95\% CI: 2.12-3.26) were more likely to
              report co-occurrence of behavioural risk factors, as well as
              respondents in Northern (aOR = 1.43; 95\% CI: 1.14-1.78), Western
              (aOR = 1.28; 95\% CI: 1.06-1.56) and Eastern Europe (aOR = 1.28;
              95\% CI: 1.06-1.55), when compared with Southern European
              respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The above analyses indicate significant
              geographical and social variation in the distribution of the
              co-occurrence of behavioural risk factors for disease
              development.",

              for children. This study examined sex differences in correlates

              that a standard environmental intervention to increase activity
              among children may not equally benefit boys and girls. METHODS:
              The System for Observation Play and Recreation in Communities was
              used to measure physical activity among 2,712 children and
              adolescents in 20 neighborhood parks in Durham, North Carolina,
              in 2007. Sedentary activity, walking, vigorous park activity, and
              energy expenditure were the primary outcome variables.
              Hierarchical logit regression models of physical activity were
              estimated separately for boys and girls. RESULTS: Type of
              activity area and presence of other active children were
              positively associated with boys' and girls' physical activity,
              and presence of a parent was negatively associated. A significant
              interaction involving number of recreation facilities in
              combination with formal activities was positively associated with
              girls' activity. A significant interaction involving formal park
              activity and young boys (aged 0-5 y) was negatively associated
              with park-based physical activity. CONCLUSION: Activity area and
              social correlates of park-based physical activity were similar
              for boys and girls; findings for formal park programming, age,
              and number of facilities were mixed. Results show that girls'
              physical activity was more strongly affected by social effects
              (eg, presence of other active children) whereas boys' physical
              activity was more strongly influenced by the availability of park
              facilities. These results can inform park planning and design.
              Additional studies are necessary to clarify sex differences in

              update the existing literature on determinants of physical
              activity and sedentary behaviour in young people, considering the
              methodological quality of the studies. METHODS: Prospective
              studies were identified from searches in PubMed and PsycINFO,
              from April 2004 through November 2010. The authors included
              studies investigating the association between determinants of
              overall physical (in)activity and/or sedentary behaviour in
              healthy children or adolescents. When a determinant was
              investigated for its association with physical (in)activity and
              sedentary behaviour assessed between ages of 4-12, or mean age
              12, it was classified as 'adolescent determinant'. Included
              articles were scored on their methodological quality and a
              best-evidence synthesis was applied to summarise the results.
              RESULTS: The authors identified 30 papers, of which seven were of
              high methodological quality. Intention was found as a determinant
              of children's physical activity. Determinants of adolescents'
              physical activity were age (ie, older children were more active),
              ethnicity (ie, being of African--American descent determined
              being less physically active) and planning. The authors found
              insufficient evidence for determinants of sedentary behaviour.
              CONCLUSION: Studies on determinants of physical activity and
              sedentary behaviour were in general of poor methodological
              quality. To develop long-term effective interventions that
              increase physical activity and decrease time spent in sedentary
              behaviours in young people, we need more high quality prospective
              evidence on the determinants of these behaviours.",

              Cross-sectional study conducted in Berne, Biel-Bienne, and
              Payerne (Switzerland) during the school year 2004/2005. Included
              1345 parental questionnaires from children out of three age
              groups (6/7, 9/10, and 13/14 years). A total of 1081 (80\%)
              provided a home address, which could be linked to environmental
              data using a geographic information system (GIS). RESULTS:
              GIS-derived main street density in a buffer of 100 m around the
              home was inversely associated with time playing outdoors in
              adolescents and younger children, but only in more urbanized
              areas. In addition and independently of GIS-based main street
              density, parental concern about traffic safety was associated
              with less time playing outdoors in primary school children.
              Girls, adolescents, and children from the French speaking part of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: To develop evidence-based interventions promoting
              healthy active lifestyles among young children and their parents,
              a greater understanding is needed of the correlates of physical
              activity and screen time in these dyads. Physical environment
              features within neighborhoods may have important influences on
              both children and their parents. The purpose of this study was to
              examine the associations between several features of the physical
              environment with physical activity and screen time among 511
              young children ($\leq$5 years old) and their parents, after
              adjusting for socio-demographic factors. METHODS: From May to
              September, 2011, parents of 0-5 year old children from Kingston,
              Canada completed a questionnaire that assessed socio-demographic
              characteristics, their physical activity and screen time, and
              their child's physical activity and screen time. Guided by a
              previously developed conceptual framework, several physical
              environment features were assessed using Geographic Information
              Systems including, function (walkability), safety (road speed),
              aesthetics (streetscape), and destination (outdoor play/activity
              space, recreation facilities, distance to closest park, yard at
              home). Multilevel linear regression analyses were used to examine
              the relationships while adjusting for several socio-demographic
              factors. RESULTS: The only independent association observed for
              the physical environment features was between higher outdoor
              play/activity space and higher screen time levels among parents.
              Several associations were observed with socio-demographic
              variables. For physical activity, child age, child care status,
              and family socioeconomic status (SES) were independent correlates
              for children while sex was an independent correlate for parents.
              For screen time, child age and family SES were independent
              correlates for children while neighborhood SES was an independent
              correlate for parents. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that
              socio-demographic factors, including social environment factors,
              may be more important targets than features of the physical
              environment for future interventions aiming to promote healthy
              active lifestyles in young children and their parents. Given this
              was one of the first studies to examine these associations in
              young child-parent dyads, future research should confirm and

              alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use among a diverse sample of
              approximately 5,500 seventh and eighth graders. We also evaluated
              the extent to which individual, family, and school factors
              mediated racial/ ethnic disparities in use. METHOD: Students
              (49\% male) from 16 participating middle schools in southern
              California reported on lifetime and past-month substance use,
              individual factors (expectancies and resistance self-efficacy),
              family factors (familism, parental respect, and adult and older
              sibling use), and school factors (school-grade use and perceived
              peer use). We used generalized estimating equations to examine
              the odds of consumption for each racial/ethnic group adjusting
              for sex, grade, and family structure. Path analysis models tested
              mediation of racial/ethnic differences through individual,
              family, and school factors. RESULTS: After adjusting for sex,
              grade, and family structure, Hispanics reported higher and Asians
              reported lower lifetime and past-month substance use, compared
              with non-Hispanic Caucasians. Rates of substance use did not
              differ between non-Hispanic African Americans and Caucasians.
              Several individual factors mediated the relationship between
              Hispanic ethnicity and substance use, including negative
              expectancies and resistance self-efficacy. Higher use among
              Hispanics was generally not explained by family or school

              whether adolescents who engage in risky behavior differ in risk
              perceptions from those who do not. We proposed that risk
              differences between risk-involved and risk-uninvolved adolescents
              depend on how risk questions are framed. High school and college
              students estimated their risk of smoking and unprotected sex by
              replying to four different questions. The results revealed that,
              for both high school and college students, smokers saw their
              outcome risk (risk of negative outcomes) as higher than that of
              nonsmokers. A similar finding was obtained for sexual behavior,
              though only for high school students. No significant differences
              between risk groups were obtained when risk was measured by
              asking about behavior risk (general riskiness of the behavior).
              Overall, the data suggest that adolescents engaged in risky
              behavior do not have a complete appreciation of their exposure to

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is
              highly prevalent, and its symptoms often represent a significant
              public health problem; thus, the aim of this study was to verify
              emergency situations caused by certain comorbidities, or by
              exposing the patient to a higher risk of accidents. DATA SOURCE:
              A literature search was carried out in the PubMed database
              between the years 1992 and 2012, using the key words ``adhd'',
              ``urgency'', ``comorbidity'', ``substance disorder'',
              ``alcohol'', ``eating disorder'', ``suicide'', ``trauma'',
              ``abuse'', ``crime'', ``internet'', ``videogame'', ``bullying'',
              and their combinations. The selection considered the most
              relevant articles according to the scope of the proposed topic,
              performed in a non-systematic way. DATA SYNTHESIS: Several
              situations were observed in which ADHD is the most relevant
              psychiatric diagnosis in relation to its urgency, such as the
              risk of accidents, suicide risk and addition, exposure to
              violence, or risk of internet abuse or sexual abuse; or when ADHD
              is the most prevalent comorbidity and is also correlated with
              emergency situations, such as in bipolar and eating disorders.
              CONCLUSIONS: The results show several comorbidities and risk
              situations involving the diagnosis of ADHD, thus reinforcing the
              importance of their identification for the adequate treatment of
              this disorder.Copyright \copyright{} 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de

  abstract = "CONTEXT: The onset of cigarette smoking typically occurs during
              childhood or early adolescence. Nicotine dependence symptoms can
              manifest soon after onset, contributing to sustained, long-term
              smoking. Previous reviews have not clarified the determinants of
              onset. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: In 2015, a systematic review of the
              literature in PubMed and EMBASE was undertaken to identify
              peer-reviewed prospective longitudinal studies published between
              January 1984 and August 2015 that investigated predictors of
              cigarette smoking onset among youth aged <18 years who had never
              smoked. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Ninety-eight conceptually different
              potential predictors were identified in 53 studies. An increased
              risk of smoking onset was consistently (i.e., in four or more
              studies) associated with increased age/grade, lower SES, poor
              academic performance, sensation seeking or rebelliousness,
              intention to smoke in the future, receptivity to tobacco
              promotion efforts, susceptibility to smoking, family members'
              smoking, having friends who smoke, and exposure to films, whereas
              higher self-esteem and high parental monitoring/supervision of
              the child appeared to protect against smoking onset. Methodologic
              weaknesses were identified in numerous studies, including failure
              to account for attrition or for clustering in samples, and
              misidentification of potential confounders, which may have led to
              biased estimates of associations. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of
              smoking onset for which there is robust evidence should be
              considered in the design of interventions to prevent first puff
              in order to optimize their effectiveness. Future research should
              seek to define onset clearly as the transition from never use to
              first use (e.g., first few puffs).Copyright \copyright{} 2016

              kindergarteners are obese or overweight. The study objective was
              to determine perceptions of the quantity of and obstacles to
              childhood physical activity in the Avondale community. Caregivers
              of children from two elementary schools were surveyed to assess
              their child's physical activity and barriers to being active.
              Three hundred and forty surveys were returned out of 1,047 for a
              response rate of 32\%. On school days, 41\% of caregivers
              reported that their children spent more than 2 h watching
              television, playing video games, or spending time on the
              computer. While over half of respondents reported that their
              children get more than 2 h of physical activity on school days,
              14\% of children were reported to be physically active less than
              1 h per day. Caregivers identified violence, cost of
              extracurricular activities, and lack of organized activities as
              barriers to their child's physical activity. The overwhelming
              majority of caregivers expressed interest in a program to make
              local playgrounds safer. In conclusion, children in Avondale are
              not participating in enough physical activity and are exposed to
              more screen time than is recommended by the AAP. Safety concerns
              were identified as a critical barrier to address in future

              examined the prospective associations between parent involvement,
              sibling companionship, and adolescent substance use at 2 points
              in mid- and late-adolescence. Adolescents were adopted (n = 568)
              or the biological offspring of both parents (n = 412).
              Cross-lagged panel results showed that higher levels of parent
              involvement in early adolescence were associated with lower
              levels of substance use later in adolescence. Results did not
              significantly differ across adoption status, suggesting this
              association cannot be due to passive gene-environment
              correlation. Adolescent substance use at Time 1 was not
              significantly associated with parent involvement at Time 2,
              suggesting this association does not appear to be solely due to
              evocative (i.e., ``child-driven'') effects either. Together,
              results support a protective influence of parent involvement on
              subsequent adolescent substance use that is environmental in
              nature. The cross-paths between sibling companionship and
              adolescent substance use were significant and negative in
              direction (i.e., protective) for sisters, but positive for
              brothers (in line with a social contagion hypothesis). These
              effects were consistent across genetically related and unrelated
              pairs, and thus appear to be environmentally mediated. For mixed
              gender siblings, results were consistent with environmentally
              driven, protective influence hypothesis for genetically unrelated
              pairs, but in line with a genetically influenced, social

              perspectives (i.e., child-identified determinants) of
              activity-friendly school playgrounds. We conducted participatory

              about their school playgrounds. At three schools, six children
              (9-12 years old) met over five to seven group meetings. Data

              between socioeconomic status (SES) and substance use. This study
              examined the associations of three indicators of family SES

              smoking, alcohol use, and marijuana use during young adulthood.
              METHOD: Data were obtained from the national Panel Study of
              Income Dynamics, a survey of U.S. families that incorporates data
              from parents and their children. In 2005 and 2007, the Panel
              Study of Income Dynamics was supplemented with two waves of
              Transition into Adulthood data drawn from a national sample of
              young adults, 18-23 years old. Data from the young adults (N =
              1,203; 66.1\% White; 51.5\% female) on their current use of
              alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana were used as outcome variables
              in logistic regressions. Socioeconomic background was calculated
              from parental reports of education, wealth, and income during the
              respondent's childhood (birth through age 17 years). RESULTS:
              Smoking in young adulthood was associated with lower childhood
              family SES, although the association was explained by demographic
              and social role covariates. Alcohol use and marijuana use in
              young adulthood were associated with higher childhood family SES,
              even after controlling for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Findings
              based on three indicators of family background SES--income,
              wealth, and parental education--converged in describing unique
              patterns for smoking and for alcohol and marijuana use among
              young adults, although functional relationships across SES
              measures varied. Young adults with the highest family background

              race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors (income and education), and
              disability on two behavioral health risk factors. METHODS: Data
              from the 2007-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
              were used to determine prevalence of cigarette smoking and
              obesity by disability status, further stratified by race and

              ethnicity ranged from 10.1 \% of Asian adults to 31.0 \% of

              evaluated to date. The primary purpose of this study was to
              provide the descriptive epidemiology of sports-related injuries
              treated in emergency departments for children and youth aged 5 -
              19. METHODS: A retrospective data analysis was performed using
              data from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention
              Program [CHIRPP] from fiscal years (April - March) 2007/08 to
              2009/10. CHIRPP is a computerized information system designed by
              the Public Health Agency of Canada that collects information
              about injuries to people evaluated in emergency departments
              across 11 pediatric hospitals and 5 general hospitals in Canada.
              Thirteen sports or activities were analyzed (baseball,
              basketball, cycling, football, ice hockey, lacrosse, ringette,
              rugby, skiing, sledding, snowboarding, soccer, and volleyball).
              Descriptive statistics, including frequency by sport, age and
              sex, as well as the percent of concussions within each sport were
              calculated. RESULTS: Out of a total of 56, 691 reported sports
              and recreational injuries, soccer accounted for the largest
              proportion of injuries with 11,941 reported cases over the 3 year
              time period. Of these, approximately 30\% were fractures. The 10
              - 14 year age group reported the greatest proportion of injuries

              housing. All 3 outcomes were directly related to percent of
              female-headed households, percent African American residents, and
              density of off-premise alcohol outlets. CONCLUSIONS: The results
              demonstrate that both population and environmental
              characteristics are significantly correlated with rates of
              childhood injuries. These results suggest that some environmental
              characteristics, in particular the presence of many off-premise
              alcohol outlets in neighborhoods, may reduce the overall level of
              guardianship of children's activities in zip code areas,
              resulting in harm to their children.",

  abstract = "The clinical notes in a given patient record contain much
              redundancy, in large part due to clinicians' documentation habit
              of copying from previous notes in the record and pasting into a
              new note. Previous work has shown that this redundancy has a
              negative impact on the quality of text mining and topic modeling
              in particular. In this paper we describe a novel variant of
              Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, Red-LDA, which
              takes into account the inherent redundancy of patient records
              when modeling content of clinical notes. To assess the value of
              Red-LDA, we experiment with three baselines and our novel
              redundancy-aware topic modeling method: given a large collection
              of patient records, (i) apply vanilla LDA to all documents in all
              input records; (ii) identify and remove all redundancy by chosing
              a single representative document for each record as input to LDA;
              (iii) identify and remove all redundant paragraphs in each
              record, leaving partial, non-redundant documents as input to LDA;
              and (iv) apply Red-LDA to all documents in all input records.
              Both quantitative evaluation carried out through log-likelihood
              on held-out data and topic coherence of produced topics and
              qualitative assessment of topics carried out by physicians show
              that Red-LDA produces superior models to all three baseline
              strategies. This research contributes to the emerging field of
              understanding the characteristics of the electronic health record
              and how to account for them in the framework of data mining. The

              which risk factors can be expected to cluster for which sub
              groups of people. This systematic review aimed to examine the
              international literature on the clustering of smoking, poor
              nutrition, excess alcohol and physical inactivity (SNAP) health
              behaviours among adults, including associated socio-demographic
              variables. Method A literature search was conducted in May 2014.
              Studies examining at least two SNAP risk factors, and using a
              cluster or factor analysis technique, or comparing observed to
              expected prevalence of risk factor combinations, were included.
              Results Fifty-six relevant studies were identified. A majority of
              studies (81\%) reported a `healthy' cluster characterised by the
              absence of any SNAP risk factors. More than half of the studies
              reported a clustering of alcohol with smoking, and half reported
              clustering of all four SNAP risk factors. The methodological
              quality of included studies was generally weak to moderate. Males
              and those with greater social disadvantage showed riskier
              patterns of behaviours; younger age was less clearly associated

              children from injuries. However, little research has examined the
              role of fathers' supervision in children's injuries. OBJECTIVES:
              This study compared the role of maternal and paternal supervision
              in children's injury risk and severity using maternal reports.
              METHODS: Mothers (n = 170) of toddlers were interviewed for 6
              months about their children's unintentional injuries. RESULTS:
              Children were more likely to engage in high activity levels and
              were at higher risk for injury when being cared for by their
              fathers. Although higher supervision predicted lower injury risk
              for both mothers and fathers, fathers' close supervision (as
              reported by mothers) was a stronger predictor of injury risk than
              mothers' supervision. CONCLUSION: Children's higher levels of
              activities may have accounted for their higher risk of injury
              when in their fathers' care. These findings indicate the need to
              include fathers in injury prevention efforts.",

              activity can inform urban design. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a
              systematic review and meta-analysis of studies linking aspects of
              the built environment with youth moderate-vigorous activity,
              including walking. DATA SOURCES: The PubMed, Embase, and
              Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)
              databases were searched using relevant key words for articles
              published between January 2000 and March 2013. STUDY SELECTION:
              The included articles reported associations between children's or
              adolescents' objectively measured physical activity and
              residential neighbourhoods or activity settings defined with
              geographical information systems (GIS), street audits or global
              positioning systems (GPS). Excluded articles did not delineate
              neighbourhoods by residential address or were not written in
              English. Of 320 potentially relevant articles, 31 met the
              inclusion criteria, but only 23 (with a total of 6,175
              participants, aged 8-17 years) provided sufficient data to derive
              effects (associations) of built-environment features on child or
              adolescent habitual moderate-vigorous activity. STUDY APPRAISAL
              AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Ten criteria were used to appraise the
              inclusion of studies. The effects were analysed as the difference
              in mean minutes of daily moderate-vigorous activity either
              between two levels of a dichotomous variable (e.g., neighbourhood
              park available or not within 800 m) or between predicted means
              corresponding to a difference of two standard deviations of a
              simple linear numeric variable (e.g., housing density per square
              kilometre). The magnitude of the difference in means was
              evaluated via standardization. The meta-analysis was performed
              with the 14 studies using GIS or street audits to relate a total
              of 58 specific built-environment features to daily activity. Each
              feature was categorized with two dichotomous variables to
              indicate whether the feature promoted playing and/or walking, and
              these variables were included in the meta-analytic model as
              moderators interacting with age and proportion of males in the
              study as linear numeric covariates. RESULTS: The meta-analysed
              effects of built-environment features that encourage play
              (including sports and fitness) and/or walking on youth
              moderate-vigorous activity ranged between trivial and small.
              There was a moderate effect of age (15 versus 9 years) whereby
              play facilities, parks, playgrounds and features that facilitate
              walking had negative effects on children's activity but positive
              effects on adolescents' activity. In studies that located youth
              physical activity with GPS, walking to school produced small
              increases in activity compared with transport by car or bus,
              greater proportions of activity took place in streets and urban
              venues (40-80\%) than in green spaces (20-50\%), and more than
              half of children's outdoor activity occurred with a parent
              nearby. LIMITATIONS: The meta-analysis cannot quantify the
              additive effect when several built-environment features are
              provided in a given neighbourhood. CONCLUSIONS: Children do not
              benefit to the same extent as adolescents from built-environment
              features that encourage walking and those designed or used for
              neighbourhood play.",

              is available. We assume all covariates being considered are
              pretreatment variables and that for each covariate it is known
              (i) whether the covariate is a cause of treatment, and (ii)
              whether the covariate is a cause of the outcome. The causal
              relationships the covariates have with one another is assumed
              unknown. We propose that control be made for any covariate that
              is either a cause of treatment or of the outcome or both. We show
              that irrespective of the actual underlying causal structure, if
              any subset of the observed covariates suffices to control for
              confounding then the set of covariates chosen by our criterion
              will also suffice. We show that other, commonly used, criteria
              for confounding control do not have this property. We use formal
              theory concerning causal diagrams to prove our result but the

              causal diagrams. An investigator simply need ask, ``Is the

              cause of the outcome?'' If the answer to either question is
              ``yes'' then the covariate is included for confounder control. We
              discuss some additional covariate selection results that preserve

              differences in HRB in youth residents within different types of
              Prague's neighborhoods in relation to the perception of the built
              environment, quality of their school and home environments. DATA
              AND METHODS: The data is based on the on-line survey among
              elementary school students aged between 14-15 years, which was
              administered in19 selected schools in Prague, during the months
              of October 2013 to March 2014. Respondents were asked their
              opinions on various issues related to their HRB, about their
              indoor and outdoor housing and school environments. The
              questionnaire was completed by 407 students. Factor analysis with
              a principal components extraction was applied to determine the
              underlying structure in the variables. A consequent field
              research was conducted to map the opportunity hot spots and
              critical places around the elementary schools. RESULTS: Binge
              drinking has been reported mainly by the students living in the
              housing estates with blocks of flats. The most frequent
              occurrence of daily smokers was found in the neighborhoods of old
              city apartment houses. High prevalence of risky marijuana use
              almost in all the surveyed types of neighborhoods. The
              respondents were more critical in their evaluation of school
              characteristics. The neighborhoods critically evaluated by the
              students as regards the school outdoor environments were the
              older apartment houses in the historical centre and inner city,
              the school indoor environment was worst assessed within the
              housing estate neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest
              that perceptions of problems in both residential and school
              environment are associated with HRB. This fact makes this issue
              of a serious importance also from the policy point of view.

              by means of questionnaires (2007-2008). Multivariate sequential
              Poisson GEE analyses were conducted (2010) to quantify the
              correlation between physical and social home and neighborhood
              characteristics and outdoor play among boys and girls aged 4-6
              years, 7-9 years, and 10-12 years. RESULTS: This study showed
              that next to proximal (home) environmental characteristics such
              as parental education (RR=0.93-0.97); the importance parents pay
              to outdoor play (RR=1.32-1.75); and the presence of electronic
              devices in the child's own room (RR=1.04-1.15), several
              neighborhood characteristics were significantly associated with
              children's outdoor play. Neighborhood social cohesion was related
              to outdoor play in five of six subgroups (RR=1.01-1.02), whereas
              physical neighborhood characteristics (e.g., green neighborhood
              type, presence of water, diversity of routes) were associated
              with outdoor play in specific subgroups only. CONCLUSIONS:
              Neighborhood social cohesion was related to outdoor play among
              children of different age and gender, which makes it a promising
              point of action for policy development. Policies aimed at
              improving physical neighborhood characteristics in relation to
              outdoor play should take into account age and gender of the
              target population.",

              perceived parental permissiveness and the expected social

              maturity. Within this population of rural male adolescents, ST
              users emphasized the social benefits of ST use, while
              acknowledging but discounting health risks. Differences and

              consistently demonstrated that rural places are more dangerous
              for motorists than urban places. Our study investigates whether
              these findings are sensitive to the definition of urban and
              rural. We use three different definitions of urban-rural continua
              to quantify and compare motor vehicle occupant fatality rates per
              person-trip and person-mile for the state of Wisconsin. The three
              urban-rural continua are defined by: (1) popular impressions of
              urban, suburban, and rural places using a system from regional
              economics; (2) population density; and (3) the intensity of
              commute flows to core urbanized areas. In this analysis, the
              three definitions captured different people and places within

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Playgrounds are important outdoor environments in
              many communities during childhood. However, playground spaces
              often do not meet the needs of typically developing children or
              children with disabilities, resulting in social exclusion for
              many children. AIMS/OBJECTIVES: This study explored the evidence
              regarding accessibility and usability of playgrounds for children
              of all abilities, to identify factors that enable or constrain
              social inclusion in community playgrounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
              A scoping method was used as little research in this area has
              been collated and synthesized. Scoping reviews are effective for
              exploring and synthesizing broad and varied methods of inquiry
              around a phenomenon of interest. RESULTS: A total of 14 key
              articles were identified and two major themes emerged: (i)
              accessible playground environments--features and factors; (ii)
              from excluding to including--making playground environments
              usable. Findings indicate that numerous environmental barriers
              contribute to making playground environments inaccessible and
              unusable for many children, particularly children with
              disabilities. However, playground design is identified as a
              significant factor in enabling inclusion. CONCLUSION:
              Occupational therapists are in an ideal position to advocate for
              children's occupational right to play, by combining knowledge of
              environmental barriers with an understanding of disability and
              specific knowledge of occupation. Through focusing on advocacy
              and change at policy and community levels, therapists can work to
              maximize social inclusion in playground settings.",

              are time-varying confounders, which may include past outcomes,
              affected by prior exposure, standard regression methods can lead
              to bias. Methods such as inverse probability weighted estimation
              of marginal structural models have been developed to address this
              problem. However, in this paper we show how standard regression
              methods can be used, even in the presence of time-dependent

              causal effects being estimated using SCMMs and marginal
              structural models, and we compare the two approaches using
              simulations. SCMMs enable more precise inferences, with greater
              robustness against model misspecification via propensity score
              adjustment, and easily accommodate continuous exposures and

              MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Concordance between self reported tobacco
              use and saliva cotinine concentration. RESULTS: Using a cut point
              of 5 ng/ml saliva cotinine to discriminate active tobacco use,
              there was a 98\% concordance between self reported non-use in the
              past month and cotinine concentration. The sensitivity of the
              questionnaire compared to the saliva cotinine test, used as the
              gold standard, was 90\% and the specificity 93\%. One hundred and
              fifteen out of 520 subjects (22\%) reported monthly tobacco use.
              Among these, 67\% (46/69) of the exclusive cigarette smokers,
              82\% (23/28) of exclusive snus users, and 94\% (15/16) of mixed
              users (cigarettes + snus) had cotinine concentrations above 5

              study confirms the reliability of adolescents' self reported
              tobacco use. In a context of low exposure to environmental
              tobacco smoke a cut off for saliva cotinine of 5 ng/ml reliably
              discriminated tobacco users from non-users. Irregular use of
              tobacco in this age group probably explains the discrepancy

              RESULTS: Three composite indicators emerged from our analysis:
              (1) Overt Risk-Taking (i.e., substance use, caffeinated energy
              drink consumption, fighting, and risky sexual behaviour), (2)
              Aversion to a Healthy Lifestyle (i.e., physical inactivity and

              Syndrome (i.e., abnormally high screen time use combined with
              unhealthy snacking). These three composite indicators of

              areas have beneficial effects on mental health; however, most
              studies have been limited to a certain or small geographic area.
              This study investigated whether parks and green areas were
              associated with the risk for depression or suicidal indicators
              among adults. METHODS: We used the 2009 Korean Community Health
              Survey data (n = 169,029). Residential geographical codes were
              used to determine the amount of parks and green areas in each
              administrative district. RESULTS: The median amount of parks and
              green areas was 19.73 m2 per capita. Compared with adults living
              the highest amount of parks and green areas (1st quartile), those
              living in regions with the lowest amount of parks and green areas
              (4th quartile) had 16-27\% greater odds for depression and
              suicidal indicators, after adjusting for all potential variables.
              People without moderate physical activity had higher odds for
              self-reported depression and suicidal ideation than those with
              moderate physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: We observed protective
              associations between parks and green areas and depression and
              suicidal indicators. In addition, moderate physical activity may
              help to lower the risk for depression and suicidal indicators.",

              review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42014013849).
              Peer-reviewed, English language studies were included. Two
              reviewers screened potentially relevant articles. Outcomes of
              interest were physical activity and sedentary behaviour levels
              and their potential correlates. Data were collected and analysed
              in 2015. Of 35 included studies, 15 reported physical activity
              prevalence, 10 reported physical activity correlates, 18 reported
              sedentary behavior prevalence, and 10 reported sedentary behavior
              correlates. Estimates of children's physical activity (34-166
              mins/day, average 86 mins/day) and sedentary behavior (126-558
              mins/day in screen time, average 271 mins/day; 428-750 mins/day
              in total sedentary behavior, average 479 mins/day) varied across
              studies. Age was consistently inversely associated, and sex
              inconsistently associated with physical activity. Age and sex
              were inconsistently associated with sedentary behavior. Sample
              sizes were small. All but one of the studies were classified as
              having high risk of bias. Few correlates have been reported in
              sufficient studies to provide overall estimates of associations.
              Potential correlates in the physical environment remain largely
              unexamined. This review highlights varying levels of physical
              activity and sedentary behavior in children with Autism Spectrum
              Disorder. Research is needed to consistently identify the

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies indicate that experimentation
              with addictive drugs and onset of addictive disorders is
              primarily concentrated in adolescence and young adulthood. The
              authors describe basic and clinical data supporting adolescent
              neurodevelopment as a biologically critical period of greater
              vulnerability for experimentation with substances and acquisition
              of substance use disorders. METHOD: The authors reviewed recent
              literature regarding neurocircuitry underlying motivation,
              impulsivity, and addiction, with a focus on studies investigating
              adolescent neurodevelopment. RESULTS: Adolescent neurodevelopment
              occurs in brain regions associated with motivation, impulsivity,
              and addiction. Adolescent impulsivity and/or novelty seeking as a
              transitional trait behavior can be explained in part by
              maturational changes in frontal cortical and subcortical
              monoaminergic systems. These developmental processes may
              advantageously promote learning drives for adaptation to adult
              roles but may also confer greater vulnerability to the addictive
              actions of drugs. CONCLUSIONS: An exploration of developmental
              changes in neurocircuitry involved in impulse control has
              significant implications for understanding adolescent behavior,
              addiction vulnerability, and the prevention of addiction in
              adolescence and adulthood.",

abstract = "Canadian adolescents have some of the highest rates of substance use in the world. The etiology of this phenomenon has not been fully explored, and one possible contextual determinant is involvement in sport activities that foster risk-taking behaviors through physical and social mechanisms. Using the 2013-14 Health Behaviour in School Aged Children (HBSC) study we therefore examined this hypothesis in a contemporary national sample of Canadian adolescents. The strength and direction of the relationship between sport and substance use varied by gender and substance, with team sport participation associated with increased binge drinking (RR 1.33 [95\% CI 1.13, 1.56] for boys, RR 1.21 [1.06, 1.38] for girls) and use of smokeless tobacco (RR 1.68 [1.34, 2.10] for boys, RR 1.32 [1.01, 1.72] for girls), but with lower prevalence levels of cannabis use (RR 0.73 [95\% CI 0.610.88]) and cigarette smoking (RR 0.79 [95\% CI 0.700.89]) in girls alone. We also compared team sport athletes with high social involvement (sports team as primary peer group) and physical involvement (higher number of days/week physically active) to those with low involvement. For boys, the combination of high physical and high social involvement was associated with the highest risk, while high social involvement alone was associated with the greatest risk for girls. While team sport participation confers only a small increased risk for substance use, the prevalence of sport participation results in a large population impact. Given this fact, interventions such as education for parents and coaches and policies encouraging engagement in a variety of extracurricular activities should be explored."
